​	能够做到零速空载运行！？



p.19: The command load torque is 0.8 p.u.



高速上不去，那就降低母线电压来等效。

Flux weakening DB-DTFC: Sensitivity to under-estimated leakage inductance…



Steady-state approximation causes current to be below 1 pu in Region I.



Why current estimation over measured one?? Estimate for one-step ahead current i(k+1)!!!



The lowest possible operating speed depends on current estimation BW? The noises will increase as current BW goes up!!!



One step ahead-estimated current can compensate the delay in the control, leading to reduction in system order by 1.
